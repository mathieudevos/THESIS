\chapter{Literature study}

In this chapter we will clearly state the research question. Before we can get to the research question we need to find out why we need to even ask this question. This is done with a small reflection on the current Internet and the evolution throughout history up to this point of the Internet. When this has been handled, the research question can be posed. Following this question the literature study will initiate with acquiring needed information to be able to provide a baseline for the question. Finally we conclude this chapter with a conclusion and a subsection about the placement of this literature study in the thesis. It also points in the direction of the needed items and information that need to be acquired before being able to answer the research question.
